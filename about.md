I am a software engineer with a passion for all things technology. My current interests include functional programming, systems programming, databases, networking, security, and devops.

I live in Chicago with my beautiful wife Kristen. We love all that the Second City has to offer, always enjoying our proximity to the lake, downtown, the arts, and the amazing dining experiences.
